'''
Byte Literals (b prefix)
Byte literals are defined with a b prefix before the opening quote of the string literal.
They represent sequences of bytes, which are immutable sequences of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.
Escape sequences in byte literals are interpreted. For example, \n is interpreted as a newline byte, and \xhh is interpreted as the byte with hexadecimal value hh.

Raw Byte Literals (rb or br prefix)
Raw byte literals combine the r (raw) prefix with the b prefix, and they can be prefixed in either order (rb or br).
They represent byte sequences where escape sequences are not processed. For example, rb'\n' represents the bytes '\\' and 'n', not a newline byte.
This is useful when you need to represent the bytes of a string without treating backslashes as escape characters.
